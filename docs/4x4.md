# 4X4 sequence player

## Introduction

4X4 is a sequence clip player. Each pad contains one clip, and a clip can be an entire Seq++ song. 4X4 must be used with Seq++, as Seq++ provides a way to get music into 4X4, and a way to edit it.

Each row of pads in 4X4 can be considered a "track". There are 4 tracks.

There are two main things that 4X4 does. Firstly, it provides an easy way way to build up a song. Since each clip can be repeated by a specific count, it is very easy to put together "verse/chorus" arrangements.

The other main use of 4X4 is for live improvisation and mangling. There [will be] many ways to mutate the sequences under CV control.

## The pads


## Remote editing

Seq++ may be used to edit the sequences inside 4X4. In order to do this you merely enable remote editing from the main context menu in Seq++.

Once remote editing is enabled, selecting any pad in 4X4 immediately sends that clip over to Seq++, where it may be edited with all the Seq++ tools. Selecting a different pad sends over a different clip.

One instance of Seq++ can edit more than one instance of 4X4.
