# 4X4 sequence player

## Introduction

4X4 is a sequence clip player. Each pad contains one clip, and a clip can be an entire Seq++ song. 4X4 must be used with Seq++, as Seq++ provides a way to get music into 4X4, and a way to edit it.

Each row of pads in 4X4 can be considered a "track". There are 4 tracks.

There are two main things that 4X4 does. Firstly, it provides an easy way way to build up a song. Since each clip can be repeated by a specific count, it is very easy to put together "verse/chorus" arrangements.

The other main use of 4X4 is for live improvisation and mangling. There [will be] many ways to mutate the sequences under CV control.

## The pads

At the moment, all the fun is in the 16 pads that give 4X4 its name. Each pad displays quite a bit of information, and clicking on the pads makes different things happen.

The pads are (currently) a dark green in their non-playing state. When the clip under a pad is playing, that pad lights up a lighter green. There will be at most one playing pad per track.

Each pad displays a little information about the musical content in the pad. The first line displays the duration of the clip in bars:beats:fractions. The next line displays the number of notes in the clip. I want to put some information about the repeat count in there sometime.

In addition, the border of the pad changes to show some things. Clicking on a pad will select it. The selected pad has a wider greyish border. At most one pad will be selected. If Seq++is being used as a remote editor, then the music in the selected pad is what is being edited.

Clicking on a pad will also set the next clip to be played on its track. The next pad to play will have an narrower, lighter border. If a clip is both selected and next to play, its border will be a combination.

Here's an example of "next play". If pad one is playing and you click on pad three, then pad one continue to play until it ends, then pad 3 will immediately start playing. By waiting until the end of a clip, everything can stay in sync much easier.

## Remote editing

Seq++ may be used to edit the sequences inside 4X4. In order to do this you merely enable remote editing from the main context menu in Seq++.

Once remote editing is enabled, selecting any pad in 4X4 immediately sends that clip over to Seq++, where it may be edited with all the Seq++ tools. Selecting a different pad sends over a different clip.

One instance of Seq++ can edit more than one instance of 4X4.
